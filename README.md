# Ansible Runbook Collection

My collection of personal Ansible runbooks, meant primarily for quickly setting 
up Debian-based servers.

## Installation

Simply download the runbooks, and ensure that nothing in your existing Ansible
configuration would conflict with these roles. 

## Contributing

Assistance is always welcome. I request that you first open an issue if you
are going to make a change that requires more than five minutes of your time,
because I would feel terrible wasting your time on something that I felt wasn't
necessary for this project. In the issue, propose the change or addition you
would like to make, your reasoning for the modification, and any design documentation
or rough plan you have to accomplish the work.

Please make sure to test and lint your code. Eventually, there will be a CI/CD
process to help with this.
